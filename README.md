# DegeneSix
KatharSys die pool roller bot.

### `.env` file
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project, this allows you to change the prefix of the bot and contains the token from Discord
````.env
DISCORD_BOT_PREFIX=!,?
DISCORD_TOKEN=AAAAAAAAAAA.11111111111111111111
````

### Docker
You don't need to install Python in your local or a host machine, a `docker-compose.yml` to build and run a container with the bot is in place, open a terminal and type
```bash
docker-compose up [-d]
```
Use the `-d` flag to run the bot in detached mode.

When you want stop the bot for whatever reason just type
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Dice Rolling

### Roll
Can be invoked with only the action number
```
!roll 8

@Pabruva rolls: 3, 1, 6, 5, 6, 2, 6, 5 
5 successes, 3 triggers
```
or the action number and the difficulty, separated by a space:
```
!roll 9 3

@Pabruva needs 3 successes and rolls: 6, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4, 2, 6, 5 
 6 successes, 2 triggers 
 Success!
```
Counts successes, triggers and checks for botches:
```
!roll 3

@Pabruva rolls: 1, 1, 2 
 0 successes, 0 triggers 
 It's a botch!
```
Limits pool to 12 and adds any extra as auto-successes:
```
!roll 24

@Pabruva rolls: 6, 5, 5, 1, 6, 6, 3, 3, 1, 6, 4, 6 
 20 successes, 5 triggers
```
You can also add automatic triggers:
```
!roll 4 4 2

@Nmarin needs 4 successes and rolls: 3, 3, 6, 1, 4
 2 successes, 3 triggers (2 automatic)
 Failure! :x:
```

### Check
It behaves like a roll, but you can also add the ability name. It also makes use of automatic triggers:
```
!check body 4 1 1

@Nmarin makes a Body check, needs 1 successes and rolls: 6, 4, 4, 2 
 3 successes, 2 triggers (1 automatic) 
 Success! :o:
```

### Combination
A combination roll of two different abilities. It also makes use of automatic triggers:
```
!combi 4 1 4 1 2

@Nmarin makes a combination check, passes the 1ยบ (adds 2 triggers), needs 1 successes for the 2ยบ and rolls: (6, 6, 5, 3) and (2, 6, 6, 2), 
 2 successes, 6 triggers (2 automatic) 
 Success! :o:

```

## Initiative
DegeneSix can also manage your initiative.
1. Use `start-initiative [label]` to register a game (where the label is optional). This will delete the active initiative in that text channel.
2. Use `!initiative [name] [dice] [ego]` to join (name and ego are optional). Each player can only have one character without a name, and cannot have any characters with duplicate names. This is to prevent confusion.
3. Use `!next` to start the initiative. At the beginning of each round, an overview of the order will be printed, and the first player's turn will begin. 
4. Use `!next` again to move to the next player's turn

DegeneSix initiative also has a verbosity feature. Use `!verbose [on/off]` to change the number of messages you receive.

Example:
```
DM: !start-initiative "My Game"
BOT: Initiative "My Game" started!
     Use !initiative [name] [dice] [ego] (name and ego are optional) to join
     Type !next to start!
@David: !initiative 5
BOT: Player @David was added to the initiative with 5 dice
@Pabruva: !initiative Falberg 6 2
BOT: Player Falberg was added to the initiative with 6 dice and 2 ego
@David: !next
BOT: Starting round 1 of initiative "My Game"...
     Initiative order:
         4:    Falberg
         2:    @David
BOT: 4 successes
     @Pabruva, it is Falberg's turn. You have 2 extra dice for your first action (from ego)
@Pabruva: !next
BOT: 2 successes
     @David, it is your turn. You have 1 extra dice (from triggers)
```
